## ChessPosition Class

### Method `Main(string[] args)`

This is the entry point of the application. It initializes a chess match and continues executing until the match is finished.

1. **Initializing the match**: The method starts by creating a new instance of a `ChessMatch` object, representing a chess match. This creates a new board and positions the pieces according to the rules of chess.

2. **Main loop**: It then enters a loop while the match is not finished (`!match.Finished`). Within this loop, the game is displayed on the console and waits for player input to make a move.

3. **Exception handling**: The main loop encompasses the entire process of playing a match, so any exceptions thrown during this process are handled. If a `BoardExceptions` type exception is thrown (for example, an invalid move), the program shows an error message and waits for the player to press Enter before continuing.

4. **Finishing the match**: When the match is finished, either by checkmate or another win condition, the loop is exited, and the final state of the match is printed to the console.

This method manages the execution of the chess game, interacting with the player, validating moves, and handling exceptions as necessary. It encapsulates all the logic for running the game within a main loop, making the code easy to understand and maintain.
